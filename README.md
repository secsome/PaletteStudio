# Palette Studio
	Palette Studio is a tool used for making RA2/TS Palettes, it is a Winform application based on NET.Framework 4.7.2. So if your computer cannot run it, please check your .NET version before reporting to me.

-	Create a new palette by using a template.
-	Draw a list of colors by “Gradient”.
-	Find the nearest color in your palette[1].
-	Import an image and convert it into a palette.
-	Merge colors into less colors.
