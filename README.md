Palette Studio is a tool used for making RA2/TS Palettes, it is a Winform application based on NET.Framework 4.7.2. So if your computer cannot run it, please check your .NET version before reporting to me.
The Palette Studio has a lot of convenient features, with the C# library ImageProcesser, it can:
-	Select multi colors at one time by using Ctrl/Shift.
-	Copy colors from one palette to another palette.
-	Create a new palette by using a template.
-	Draw a list of colors by “Gradient”.
-	Find the nearest color in your palette[1].
-	Import an image and convert it into a palette.
-	Merge colors into less colors.
-	Export the current palette as a template.
	There might be several issues in this program, if you find any, please report it to me at 3179369262@qq.com.
	Thanks to Fantasycho, who helped to test for this program and made valuable suggestions, also icon and images.
	The code reading PCX files refer to ImageFormats. And the INI and PAL files refer to relert-sharp. Thanks to the developers of these projects.
	Be warn! This program won’t be a open-sourced one for some reason.
